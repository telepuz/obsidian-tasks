These searches are for experimenting with, and understanding, the new "Includes" facility, which was released in Tasks X.Y.Z.

presets values can be defined in the Tasks settings.

explain: `INPUT[toggle:TQ_explain]`

## List all the known 'include' values in settings

(assuming there is not one called `xxxx`!)

````text
```tasks
preset xxxx
```
````

```tasks
preset xxxx
```

## Find tasks in the same folder as the query (and not sub-folder)

explain: `INPUT[toggle:TQ_explain]`

````text
```tasks
preset this_folder_only
```
````

```tasks
preset this_folder_only
```

## Find tasks in folders other than the folder tree containing the query

explain: `INPUT[toggle:TQ_explain]`

````text
```tasks
preset this_folder_only
group by folder
```
````

```tasks
NOT ({{preset.this_folder}})
group by folder
```

## Show all the fields

explain: `INPUT[toggle:TQ_explain]`

````text
```tasks
```
````

```tasks
```

## Hide all the fields

explain: `INPUT[toggle:TQ_explain]`

````text
```tasks
preset hide_date_fields
preset hide_non_date_fields
```
````

```tasks
preset hide_date_fields
preset hide_non_date_fields
```

## Hide all the Tasks user interface elements

explain: `INPUT[toggle:TQ_explain]`

````text
```tasks
preset hide_query_elements
```
````

```tasks
preset hide_query_elements
```

## Show only the description and any tags

explain: `INPUT[toggle:TQ_explain]`

````text
```tasks
preset hide_everything
```
````

```tasks
preset hide_everything
```

## Just show the description, without tags

explain: `INPUT[toggle:TQ_explain]`

````text
```tasks
preset just_the_description
```
````

```tasks
preset just_the_description
```

## Advanced use: return a function, that takes a parameter from the query source

### Has context 'home' - and group by the Include text - version 1

explain: `INPUT[toggle:TQ_explain]`

````text
```tasks
# For debug/explanatory purposes, show the source of the Include as a group name:
group by function const x = "{{preset.filter_by_context}}"; return x

{{preset.filter_by_context}}('home')
```
````

```tasks
# For debug/explanatory purposes, show the source of the Include as a group name:
group by function const x = "{{preset.filter_by_context}}"; return x

{{preset.filter_by_context}}('home')
```

### Has context 'home' - and group by the Include text - version 2

explain: `INPUT[toggle:TQ_explain]`

````text
```tasks
# For debug/explanatory purposes, show the source of the Include as a group name:
group by function const x = "{{preset.extract_contexts_1}}"; return x

# includes.extract_contexts_1 value needs to be surrounded by parentheses ():
filter by function return ({{preset.extract_contexts_1}})('home')
```
````

```tasks
# For debug/explanatory purposes, show the source of the Include as a group name:
group by function const x = "{{preset.extract_contexts_1}}"; return x

### Has context 'home' - and group by the Include text - version 3

explain: `INPUT[toggle:TQ_explain]`

````text
```tasks
# For debug/explanatory purposes, show the source of the Include as a group name:
group by function const x = "{{preset.extract_contexts_2}}"; return x

# includes.extract_contexts_1 value has the parentheses, to simplify use:
filter by function {{preset.extract_contexts_2}}('home')
```
````

```tasks
# For debug/explanatory purposes, show the source of the Include as a group name:
