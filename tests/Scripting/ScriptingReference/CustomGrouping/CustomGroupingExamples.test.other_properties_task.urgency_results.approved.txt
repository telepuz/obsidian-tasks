group by function task.urgency
Show non-integer urgency values to 5 decimal places, and integer ones to 0 decimal places.
Sorting of groups by name has been found to be unreliable with varying numbers of decimal places.
So to ensure consistent sorting, Tasks will round non-integer numbers to a fixed 5 decimal places, returning the value as a string.
This still sorts consistently even when some of the group's values are integers.
