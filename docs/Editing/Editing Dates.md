# Editing Dates

<span class="related-pages">#feature/dates</span>

## Summary

Tasks supports a range of date properties for managing your tasks: see [[Dates]].

This page describes ways to add, edit and remove date values on tasks.

There is a [[#Date-picker on task dates]] and a [[#Context menu on task dates]], or you can use various [[#other date-editing options]].

## Date-picker on task dates

> [!released]
> Introduced in Tasks 7.14.0.

**Left-click on any task date field** in **Reading mode** and **Tasks query search results** to use a date-picker and calendar to edit or remove a date.

![Hover over a date in Read mode or Tasks query search results](../images/date-picker-1.png)

![In the date-picker, you can easily select a new date, or clear the current one](../images/date-picker-2.png)

| Where                         | Viewing Mode | Works? |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | ------ |
| Task lines in markdown files  | Source mode  | ‚ùå     |
| Task lines in markdown files  | Live Preview | ‚ùå     |
| Task lines in markdown files  | Reading mode | ‚úÖ     |
| In Tasks query search results | Live Preview | ‚úÖ     |
| In Tasks query search results | Reading mode | ‚úÖ     |

On iPhone, and probably iPad too, this date-picker hard-codes the start of the week to Monday, instead of respecting the user's settings. We are tracking this in [issue #3239](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/issues/3239).

## Context menu on task dates

> [!released]
> Introduced in Tasks 7.10.0.

**Right-click on any task date field** in **Reading mode** and **Tasks query search results** to:

- postpone Start, Scheduled and Due dates
- advance Created, Cancelled and Done dates
