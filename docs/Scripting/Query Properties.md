# Query Properties

<span class="related-pages">#feature/scripting</span>

> [!released]
>
> - Query Properties were introduced in Tasks 4.7.0.
> - Their direct use in Custom Filters and Custom Groups, without the use of Placeholders, was introduced in Tasks 5.1.0.

## Introduction

In a growing number of locations, Tasks allows programmatic/scripting access to properties of the file containing the search query:

- [[Placeholders]]
- [[Custom Filters]]
- [[Custom Sorting]]
- [[Custom Grouping]]

This page documents all the available pieces of information in Queries that you can access.

1. The presence of `.md` filename extensions is chosen to match the existing conventions in the Tasks filter instructions [[Filters#File Path|path]] and [[Filters#File Name|filename]].

1. `query.file.filenameWithoutExtension` was added in Tasks 4.8.0.

    - If [[Global Filter|global filter]] is enabled, only tasks containing the global filter are included.
